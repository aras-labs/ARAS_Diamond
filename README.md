**Paper abstract:**  Deriving the accurate dynamic model of robots is pivotal for robot design, control, calibration, and fault detection. To derive an accurate dynamic model of robots, all the terms affecting the robot's dynamics are necessary to be considered, and the dynamic parameters of the robot must be identified with appropriate physical insight. In this paper, first, the kinematics of the ARAS-Diamond spherical parallel robot, which has been developed for vitreoretinal ophthalmic surgery, are investigated, then by presenting a formulation based on the principle of virtual work, a linear form of robot dynamics is derived, and the obtained results are validated in SimMechanics environment. Furthermore, other terms affecting the robot dynamics are modeled, and by using the linear regression form of the robot dynamics with the required physical bounds on the parameters, the identification process is accomplished adopting the least-squares method with appropriate physical consistency. Finally, by using the criteria of the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and using different trajectories, the accuracy of the identified dynamic parameters is evaluated. The experimental validation results demonstrate a good fitness for the actuator torques (about 75 percent), and a positive mass matrix in the entire workspace, which allows us to design the common model-based controllers such as the computer torque method, for precise control of the robot in vitreoretinal ophthalmic surgery..
